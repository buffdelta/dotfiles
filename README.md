# Vimrc

This is my template for vim custimizations that I use. I store it in this folder to ensure that if something were to happen to my PC or Laptop, I could keep this.

# Bashrc

Needs dconf, and https://github.com/dracula/gnome-terminal for terminal colors.
These contain some of my basic custimizations for my bash terminal prompt.
